				<div class="mainbox">
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The idea for the project is a mostly traditional survival horror game set in a research facility at the bottom of the ocean. The game will be built in unity and will have many features present in other survival horror games but will also feature new ones to make it more unique and stand out from the crowd. It should have 4-7 hours of gameplay like many indie horror games but for the time restrictions of the project it will have much less. The game will also have low poly graphics for 2 reasons, as a homage to the older games and their art styles and because at this stage something better is likely not possible with my skill set.</p>
				
				</div>
				<div class="mainbox">
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>The main motivation behind this project is that there aren't many horror games set at the bottom of the ocean even though many people find it to be incredibly scary which is a great opportunity to get in on a possibly large market. 
				<br>I also believe there should be more horror games of some quality rather than shovel ware designed to cheap scares on the market. A simple search of unity horror games brings up hundreds of results which will be addressed later as it is a misrepresentation of unity but a good example of how there is a desire for more short horror experiences. 
				<br>The project is also about unique mechanics or the situations which arise in the environment it is set in, the idea behind it being "what does someone encounter in an underwater facility that is collapsing in on itself".</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="mainbox">
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>As a base the game will feature mechanics featured in many other survival horror games so as to be understandable to older players but also because they have been iterated and improved upon enough over the years that are not only important to the genre but are fun to play with.</p>
				<h3>these features include:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Horror (unsettling enemies or environment)</li>
					<li>Inventory management (very limited carrying capacity)</li>
					<li>Limited resources (scarce ammo, health, saves)</li>
					<li>Defensive gameplay (you aren't killing waves of enemies, they have the advantage)</li>
					<li>Isolation (you are alone or with few people and there is no clear way of escape)</li>
					<li>Hindered movement (this can be locked doors, cramped hallways or block pathways but it can also be player input eg. tank controls, static camera)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list and to an extent only 2 things are required, horror and limited resources. As mentioned several times before there will also be new mechanics which stem from the environment you are in, these are:</p>
				<h3>Water</h3>
				<p>environment will be flooded meaning it is harder to move, see and breath within which is obvious and present in any game with water in it but there is more, it also means certain items will become waterlogged and unusable and might have to be repaired because of this. There will be ways to deal with this such as a waterproof bag which can carry single items or items of certain sizes preventing some items from being brought through areas entirely. Water also brings along the issue of oxygen which can make moving through a room more stressful as you have to manage your oxygen while also dealing with the threats in the room.</p>
				<h3>Water Pressure</h3>
				<p>along with water there will be water pressure, this isn't a full simulation of pressure but will likely be a simple low pressure or high pressure mechanic. While in a low pressure room you may only need a respirator to move through a low pressure room and items will only become wet, in a high pressure room you will need a diving suit to move which will also further hinder movement and items which may have been fine in low pressure could collapse under the high pressure. Rooms could also be drained of water or have the pressure reduced to allow better movement o but at the cost of limited resources or they could be filled with water to acquire these resources but at the cost of making it harder to traverse.</p>
				<h3>Enemies</h3>
				<p>the monsters you encounter will also change based on their environment. As deep sea creatures the enemies are more adapted to the high pressure, so they can move faster than the player in that sort of environment but lower the pressure or remove it entirely and they become lumbering and slow.</p>

				<div class="mainbox">
				<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
				<h3>Untiy</h3>
				<p>the game will be built in unity as it is easy to learn having features such as event scripting and support for multiple languages such as python, c# and c++ as well as visual coding. Unity also has many resources online which can teach you surface level knowledge or stuff much more in depth, it is well documented, easy to learn but hard to master.
				<br>A lot of people have a negative image of unity as being a bad engine used only for asset flips and shovel ware but many big studios use it, some games include Hearthstone, rust, wasteland 3, risk of rain 2 and dusk and in terms of horror games there is compound fracture, gloomwood, layers of fear and GTFO. 
				<br>unity requires a licence to make games for commercial purposes where more than $100k in revenue otherwise a personal license is fine. (unity FAQ: Licensing & activation)</p>
				<h3>Blender</h3>
				<p>blender is free and open source modeling software and will be used to create models in.
Blender allows you to create and map models with a variety of textures and filters. It is well documented and is used widely in the art industry by professionals and amateurs alike. 
<br>Blender does not require a commercial licence as it is open source and free to use by anyone (Blender: about license)
				</p>
				<p>A computer which can run both these programs is required. The minimum specs for blender and unity as stated on their official sites</p>
				<h3>The minimum specs for Blender are</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>64-bit dual core 2Ghz CPU with SSE2 support</li>
					<li>4 GB RAM</li>
					<li>1280Ã—768 display</li>
					<li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li>
					<li>Graphics card with 1 GB RAM, OpenGL 3.3</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>The minimum specs for unity are</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows 7 or 10 64bit only</li>
					<li>X64 architecture with SSE2 instruction set support</li>
					<li>Dx 10 +</li>
				<!-- i dont know why this is centred-->
				<p>No hardware was specified on for unity</p>
				</ul>
				<!--i think there is an open container somewhere but w3vaildate cant find it either-->

				<h3>Skills required</h3>
				<p>In order to finish this project some skills will be required, these include:</p>
				<h3>Coding knowledge</h3>
				<p>in order to script in unity i will need some level of coding knowledge. I have 2 options, using the official unity addon that allows scripting in python and or using the visual coding engine within unity. I am learning python already and the visual coding within unity is supposed to make it easier to make games so i will try to use both, this part will be the most feasible as i already have some background with it.</p>
				<h3>3d Modeling Knowledge</h3>
				<p> in order to make the models that are going in game i will need some level of 3d modeling knowledge. I have almost no knowledge on how to 3d model but it is well documented and there are plenty of tutorials to assist, this is somewhat feasible but will likely be the hardest part</p>
				<h3>Audio engineering</h3>
				<p>the project will require sound as it is a game after all. There will be some resources that can help with this but i have no audio background what so ever so this will be a new landscape to me. This is the least feasible part as it will require learning it from scratch.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="mainbox">
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>the outcome of this project if all is successful is a video game that is feature complete meaning it has all or most of the promised features functioning, it is playable from start to finish and the game should immerse the player in the environment. i cant imagine this project having much of an impact on anything but at best it could become a passing trend to make deep-sea horror games as is often the case when a genre of horror game becomes popular.</P>
